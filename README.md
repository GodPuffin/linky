## 🤔 What is Linky? 

Researching can be complicated. Reading through possible sources just to see there isn't actually important information, having to read through heaps of information on a research paper to extract one bit of information, etc. **Linky** is here to **change** that for you.

Give Linky a *URL* (an article, Wikipedia page, etc.) and watch it **parse** all the data into different **chunks**! Then, ask Linky a question. **Linky** will **leverage** the information from that article and answer your question accurately based on what it read! 🤖💡

## 🛠️ Technology used 

- **Vector Database**: Pinecone
