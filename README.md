## 🤔 What is Linky? 

> [!NOTE]  
> **Linky** was developed in <24hrs for [MariHacks](https://www.marihacks.com/)' 2024 Hackathon!

Researching can be complicated. Reading through possible sources just to see there isn't actually important information, having to read through heaps of information on a research paper to extract one bit of information, etc. **Linky** is here to **change** that for you.

Give Linky a *URL* (an article, Wikipedia page, etc.) and watch it **parse** all the data into different **chunks**! Then, ask Linky a question. **Linky** will **leverage** the information from that article and answer your question accurately based on what it read! 🤖💡

## 💡 Inspiration 
When diving into new projects, navigating extensive documentation across various technologies can be overwhelming, especially when seeking specific information. We recognized this challenge and aimed to simplify the process by creating a tool that streamlines access to relevant content.

## 🚀 What it does
Linky harnesses the power of an AI model, integrated with a Pinecone Vector database. Users input a URL, which is then processed through the vector database. With the selected URL, users can pose questions to Linky. Leveraging the queried data, Linky generates accurate responses, all while crediting the sourced information.

## 🛠️ Technology 
- Implemented using TypeScript
- Utilized Mantime for project management
- Deployed on Vercel
- Leveraged Pinecone Vector Database for data retrieval
- RAG AI model using Vercel's AI SDK for retrieval and generation

## 🤔 Challenges 
- Addressing text wrapping issues with retrieved data
- Dealing with continuous development challenges, as the model required deployment for updates related to data generation

## 🏆 Accomplishments 
- Achieving mobile functionality 📱
- Delivering a polished end result ✨
- Deepening our understanding of the technologies involved 🧠
- Successfully staying awake for over 24 hours to meet project goals 😴

## 📚 What we learned 
- Gained comprehensive knowledge about each technology within our tech stack

##🔮 What's next for Linky 
- Enhancing mobile responsiveness
- Improving the display of retrieved data 📊
